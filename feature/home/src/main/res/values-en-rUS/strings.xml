We currently use student computers, but even so, there will be a monthly fee.\nTherefore, we hope that users of BILIBILIAS can support some expenses, such as breakfast, milk tea and lunch, which can meet most of the expenses of BILIBILIAS.\nFinally, I would like to thank all users who have donated and supported AS for BILIBILIAS.\nYou can donate anonymously and anonymously. It is recommended not to donate anonymously.\nBring contact information such as AS and QQ number. "</string>
